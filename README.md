# models
Raw CNN &amp; FAM model generation

We need TensorFlow version 0.10+ to run.

Also you need Keras, which can be installed easily from pip.

# To generate documentation use:

doxygen models.dox

# Note

Please use the FAM model at the moment, I'm just tweaking the CNN model, as I need to implement 64 sample shifts.
